This file contains a bunch of planned improvements to the DavorKey
keyboard layout.

* TODO Create a Visual Guide Showing the Keybindings
  It would be helpful for new and potential users to be able to see
  what the keyboard layout looks like before "buying in" to the
  concept.

* TODO Write a README file

* TODO Add support for a german u with two dots
  Bind it to the =u= key.

* TODO Add support for the Euro key
  Either bind it to =e=, or to the 'default' location.
